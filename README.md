## 💚 What is KohliVerse?

KohliVerse is a niche community platform where fans can **submit, discover, and rank** the best Virat Kohli edit videos from YouTube and Instagram — all in one place.

We don't host videos. We embed them. Think of it as a curated, competitive leaderboard for the most epic Kohli edits on the internet.

## 🏏 Why I Built This (A Die-Hard Fan's Story)

I'm a die-hard Virat Kohli fan. Been following him since 2008. Every time he plays an innings that takes my breath away, I go looking for edits on YouTube and Instagram. But here's the problem:

- 📱 Edits are scattered across 10 different accounts
- 🔍 No way to find the **best** ones quickly
- 👍 No ranking system to know what's truly trending
- 👥 No community to discuss and appreciate the edits

**KohliVerse is my solution.**

I wanted a place where:
- Fans can submit their favorite edits
- The community votes on what deserves to be at the top
- Top creators get recognized
- Everyone can discover new edits instantly

This is built by a fan, for fans. 🇮🇳
